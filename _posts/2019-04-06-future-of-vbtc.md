Dear clients, friends and fellow Bitcoiners,
Since 2014 the team of VBTC has been serving the Vietnamese market as Vietnam’s very first VND-BTC live trading platform.

VBTC performed these functions as part of the Bitcoin Vietnam (BitcoinVN) team which had launched its BTC-VND retail brokerage service just a few months prior to the inception of VBTC.

The recent changes made in the strategic direction and ownership structure of BitcoinVN accompanied by the launch of BitcoinVN’s own live exchange BitcoinVN.cloud however make it necessary to outline our vision for VBTC and the wider Bitcoin ecosystem.


We still maintain friendly and a collaborative working relationship with the team of BitcoinVN. For a transition period the well-established cooperation in terms of shared customer service or certain middle management resources will be maintained.

BitcoinVN under the leadership of Nguyen Tran Bao Phuong, Dominik Weil and Alex Winter pioneered in Vietnam at a time when barely anybody in the general population even have heard about the word “Bitcoin” and performed over the years a very valuable service to bring this technology closer to the Vietnamese population while providing a safe environment in a space unfortunately riddled by scammers and other shady operators. 

They and their fellow co-founders sacrificed years of their lives in the attempt to do the right thing while taking on a broad variety of risks which come with venturing into such a new area where nobody has ever gone before amidst a murky regulatory situation in Vietnam. 

We have therefore full understanding for their situation and their attempt to lead BitcoinVN in the future via the partnership with Maytrade Global in order to compete with the  giants in this space.

But it also must be stated that this is not going to be the route for VBTC.

While we believe that the commitment of the leadership of BitcoinVN to the cause of Bitcoin remains unabated, we will not take part in providing access to various distractions and questionable projects to the public.

We do not want to lend our legitimacy to any projects or so-called “cryptocurrencies” which have not been created with the spirit of Satoshi in mind.

VBTC will therefore continue to exclusively cater Bitcoin as the - in our point of view - only viable global money of the future.

While some might deride this stance as extreme or even as “toxic Bitcoin maximalism”, we believe that - by looking at the combined forces and lessons of history, economics, human behaviour, network effects and computer science - all rational arguments can only lead to this outcome.

And we do not want to mislead people by giving them the impression that there are actual alternatives to Bitcoin, just to make a quick buck from it. There aren’t. If Bitcoin fails to succeed, the whole “crypto movement” which rides on its coattails has failed in its ambitions.

We see ourselves in good company with this stance. Just recently Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey expressed that his companies will solely focus their efforts on Bitcoin, while a well-renowned tech visionary and contrarian investor such as Peter Thiel (who most recently correctly predicted the victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential elections against the prevailing mainstream narrative) stated that "I would be long bitcoin, and neutral to skeptical of just about everything else at this point".

With our decision to go “all in” Bitcoin we might not maximize our revenue in the short term, but we will be able to look into  the mirror knowing that we are doing the right thing.

Yours faithfully,

Team VBTC - Your Bitcoin Exchange in Vietnam
